# Introduction
This data story is based on the San Francisco Crime Dataset (2003-2025), which is a comprehensive record of crime incidents reported by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). The dataset originally covers various types of criminal activities, including assault, burglary, etc. However, my focus here is specifically on incidents categorized as “LARCENY THEFT”. I keep the following relevant attributes from the original dataset: Incident Date--The date when the crime was reported; Incident Time--The exact time of day the crime occurred; Incident Category--Classification of the crime type (filtered for “LARCENY THEFT” here); Police District: Geographic district within San Francisco where the incident was reported; Latitude and Longitude--Precise geographic coordinates pinpointing the location of each incident. This story aims to communicate clearly to the readers, enhancing public awareness and understanding of larceny theft.
